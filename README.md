# MiCSS (Micro Colorectal Cancer Screening Simulator)
Copyright (C) 2024 Tomás Álvarezz

MiCSS is a microsimulation model designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening strategies. The model simulates the natural history of CRC and the screening process for individuals in a defined population. MiCSS is intended to assist policymakers and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding CRC screening programs.

## Features
- Simulates the lives of individuals within a specified population.
- Evaluates the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening strategies.
- Allows for the analysis of different screening scenarios and adherence rates.
- Provides insights into the impact of screening on CRC prognosis and healthcare costs.

# Folder structure
Folders with a `1.` prefix contain demographic data. Here is a breakdown of their contents:

- `initial_data`: This folder holds the raw demographic data.
- `data_preprocessing_functions`: Contains Python scripts that preprocess the raw data and create plots. These plots are saved in the `4.data_plots` folder.
- `processed_data`: Stores the results of preprocessing the raw data.

Folders with a `2.` prefix contain the simulation code. Here is a breakdown of its contents:

- `simulation`: This folder includes all the code required for running the simulation:
- `population.py`: Contains classes necessary for simulating the population.
- `person.py`: Contains classes that define the individual characteristics and behaviors of persons in the simulation.
- `parameters.py`: Holds the default parameters for the simulation.
- `crc_life_expectancies.py`: Includes code for calculating life expectancies of individuals with colorectal cancer.
- `life_expectancy.py`: Includes code for calculating life expectancies of individuals without colorectal cancer.
- `main.py`: Contains the scenarios to be executed in the simulation.

- `population_test_file.py`: Is a test population which only has 100 persons in the simulation for testing purposes

Folders with a `3.` prefix contain the scenario analysis code. Here is a breakdown of its contents:

- `scenario_analysis`: This folder includes scripts for analyzing the scenarios generated by the simulation. The scripts are numbered from `2` to `10`, each performing an analysis on a different set of scenarios. The outputs of these analyses are:
  - `costs_summary.csv`: Saved in the folder of each simulation scenario.
  - Plots: Costs, Screening Analysis and Treatments saved in the `4.analysis_plots` folder.

Folders with a `4.` prefix contain various outputs from the simulation and data analysis. Here is a breakdown of their contents:

- `analysis_plots`: Stores all the plots generated from the analysis of scenarios.
- `data_plots`: Contains all the plots produced from the analysis of demographic data.
- `simulation_outputs`: Holds all the CSV files that contain the results of each simulation scenario.

## Usage
0. Before running new simulations, delete all folders within the `simulations` folder. If these folders are not removed, the program will detect them as completed simulations and will not rerun them.
1. Run the `1.main.py` file in the `2.simulation` folder from the root directory. This script executes multiple scenarios and saves each scenario's results in its own folder within the `simulations` directory.
2. Run the remaining numbered scripts in the `3.scenario_analysis` folder to analyze the outcomes of the scenarios. These scripts will generate plots and save them in the `4.analysis_plots` folder.

## Model Validation
The model has undergone partial validation by the researcher. Further validation is recommended following the techniques described in the study by [Eddy et al. ,2012](https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(12)01656-7/fulltext?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1098301512016567%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)

## Reusability
While initially designed for CRC screening in the southern district of Santiago, Chile, the model holds potential for adaptation to other healthcare settings and conditions. Researchers are encouraged to improve upon and utilize this model for various diseases and locations.
